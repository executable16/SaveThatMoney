# SaveThatMoney
#### Just a POC, Expense monitoring to encourage saving in a game sort of way. You feed in your monthly income and expenses, you could set goals like buying movie tickets or planning a dinner or maybe buying gifts for loved ones or saving for projects etc. Every month it reminds how close/far you are to achieving that goal, once you reach goal, you get rewards :P.
